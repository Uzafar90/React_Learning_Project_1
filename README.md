# 100DaysOfCode (React)

## I am currently learning React.js as part of my 100daysOfCode journey. Throughout this journey, I will be creating three projects from beginner to advanced levels. I am concentrating on the fundamentals of React, like components, state management, and props, which are essential for building websites. Additionally, the project helps me learn how to optimize website performance for faster loading and smoother operation. I'm excited to keep learning and use React.js to create fantastic websites in the future.
